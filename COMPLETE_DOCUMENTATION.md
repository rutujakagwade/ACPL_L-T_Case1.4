**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: October 7, 2025  
**Generated By**: GitHub Copilot

## Executive Summary

The L&T Sales Tracker is a comprehensive mobile application built with Expo React Native and Node.js, designed to help track sales activities and manage member journeys. The application features a role-based architecture supporting users (sales team members), admins, and super admins, with different capabilities and access levels for each role.

The system consists of a React Native mobile application (with web support) built using Expo's bare workflow, allowing for native code customization while maintaining Expo's development benefits. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database, and includes features like file uploads (via Cloudinary), email notifications, and secure authentication.

This documentation provides complete coverage of setting up, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining the application for both technical and semi-technical team members.
